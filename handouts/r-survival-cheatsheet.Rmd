## Packages

The **dplyr**, **survival**, and **survminer** packages from CRAN are required for this lesson. For looking at TCGA data, you'll also need **RTCGA**, **RTCGA.clinical**, and **RTCGA.mRNA** from Bioconductor. Here's how to install them (do this once).

\bigskip

```r
# Install from CRAN --------------------------
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("survminer")

# Install from Bioconductor ------------------
# Install Bioconductor core packages first
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite()
# Next install RTCGA and RTCGA data packages
biocLite("RTCGA")
biocLite("RTCGA.clinical")
biocLite("RTCGA.mRNA")
```

\bigskip

After installing these packages, load them in each session you use them.

\bigskip

```r
# CRAN Packages needed
library(dplyr)     # loads dplyr
library(survival)  # core survival analysis functions
library(survminer) # recommended for visualizing survival curves

# Bioconductor packages
library(RTCGA)
library(RTCGA.clinical)
library(RTCGA.mRNA)
```

## Functions

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
knitr::kable(read.csv("r-survival-cheatsheet.csv", check.names=FALSE))
```

## The pipe: **`%>%`**

When you load the **dplyr** package you can use **`%>%`**, the _pipe_. Running **`x %>% f(args)`** is the same as **`f(x, args)`**. If you wanted to run function `f()` on data `x`, then run function `g()` on that, then run function `h()` on that result: instead of nesting multiple functions, **`h(g(f(x)))`**, it's preferable and more readable to create a chain or pipeline of functions: **`x %>% f %>% g %>% h`**. Pipelines can be spread across multiple lines, with each line ending in `%>%` until the pipeline terminates. The keyboard shortcut for inserting `%>%` is Cmd+Shift+M on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+M on Windows.
