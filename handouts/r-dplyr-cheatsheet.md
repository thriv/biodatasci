# Keyboard shortcuts

**Run source line(s) in console**: Command+Enter (Ctrl+Enter on Windows)

**Insert assignment operator, `<-`**: Alt+`-` (dash)

**Insert pipe operator, `%>%`**: Cmd+Shift+M (Ctrl+Shift+M on Windows)

**Cancel / get unstuck**: Escape key. If you forget to close a paranthesis, quote, etc., and your R prompt shows `+` instead of `>`, focus cursor on console, and hit the Escape key.


# General setup / options

- Tools, Global Options: 
    - Uncheck "Restore .RData into workspace at startup"
    - Set to _Never_: "Save workspace to .RData on exit: Never"
- Use Projects! Create a project with _File -- New Project_.
    - This creates a `.Rproj` file. This is just a metadata file that opens R _running in that folder_ so R is running where your data lives.
    - _File -- New File -- New R Script_ creates a new R script in your project folder. Save this script and write commands in a script. Use new scripts for new tasks/classes.

# Packages

If you don't have a particular package installed already: `install.packages(packagename)`. Only **dplyr**, **readr**, and **tidyr** are strictly required. Load packages in each script each time you start R/RStudio.

```r
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
```


# dplyr verbs

- **`filter()`**: Limits _rows_ -- returns only rows matching conditions
- **`select()`**: Limits _columns_ based on name, position, etc.
- **`mutate()`**: Adds new variables, modifies existing variables
- **`arrange()`**: Arranges data in ascending order (use `desc(var)` to arrange descending)
- **`summarize()`**: Reduces multiple values down to a single value
- **`group_by()`**: Groups a data.frame/tibble by one or more variables. Most useful with `summarize()`.


# The pipe: **`%>%`**

When you load the **dplyr** library you can use **`%>%`**, the _pipe_. Running **`x %>% f(args)`** is the same as **`f(x, args)`**. If you wanted to run function `f()` on data `x`, then run function `g()` on that, then run function `h()` on that result: instead of nesting multiple functions, **`h(g(f(x)))`**, it's preferable and more readable to create a chain or pipeline of functions: **`x %>% f() %>% g() %>% h()`**. Pipelines can be spread across multiple lines, with each line ending in `%>%` until the pipeline terminates. The keyboard shortcut for inserting `%>%` is Cmd+Shift+M on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+M on Windows.
