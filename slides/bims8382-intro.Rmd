## Week 1 (today!): Intro to R

Novice-level introduction to the R, RStudio, and basic functionality such as creating variables, getting help, using data frames, basic plotting, and reading/writing files.

**Why R?**

- Free
- Huge community support
- 10,000+ free add-on packages
- [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org): huge resource for bioinformatics-specific functionality, packages, data, ...
- [Amazing graphics](https://www.google.com/search?q=ggplot2&tbm=isch)
- Reproducible research (Week 4)
- Tons of resources ([StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science), ...)

## Week 2 (Feb 19): Advanced Data Manipulation & Tidy Data

**[Janitor work](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html):** Filtering, reshaping, subsetting, split-apply-combine, joining, etc.

1. Survival analysis in R using built-in data
    - Survival curves + life tables
    - Kaplan-Meier curves
    - Cox proportional hazards regression
1. Example with TCGA data

## Week 7 (Mar 26) {.smaller}

### _Option A:_ Predictive Modeling & Forecasting

1. Data pre-processing: feature extraction & imputation
1. Model training, tuning, resampling, and prediction
1. Forecasting at scale

### _Option B_: Introduction to RNA-seq Data Analysis

1. Data overview: source, pre-processing, structure
1. Processing and analysis with [DESeq2](http://bioconductor.org/packages/DESeq2)
1. Pathway analysis

### _Option C_: Phylogenetic Trees
