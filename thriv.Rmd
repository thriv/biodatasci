## Setup

**[Click the <i class="fa fa-cog"></i> Setup](setup.html) link on the navbar at the top and review all the information and follow the instructions _prior to the workshop_**.

You should set aside a couple hours to download, install, and test all the software needed for the course. All the software we're using in class is open-source and freely available online. This setup must be completed _prior to class_, as we will not have much time for troubleshooting software installation issues during class. [Email Stephen Turner](people.html) if you're having difficulty.

After installing and testing the software we'll be using, please download the data as instructed, and review the required reading _prior to class_.



## Course Schedule

_(Subject to change)_

### Week 1: Intro to R

This novice-level introduction is directed toward life scientists with little to no experience with statistical computing or bioinformatics. This interactive introduction will introduce the R statistical computing environment. The first part of this workshop will demonstrate very basic functionality in R, including functions, functions, vectors, creating variables, getting help, filtering, data frames, plotting, and reading/writing files.

### Week 2: Advanced Data Manipulation with R

Data analysis involves a large amount of janitor work -- munging and cleaning data to facilitate downstream data analysis. This session assumes a basic familiarity with R and covers tools and techniques for advanced data manipulation. It will cover data cleaning and "tidy data," and will introduce R packages that enable data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using split-apply-combine strategies. Upon completing this lesson, students will be able to use the _dplyr_ package in R to effectively manipulate and conditionally compute summary statistics over subsets of a "big" dataset containing many observations.

### Week 3: Advanced Data Visualization with R and ggplot2

This session will cover fundamental concepts for creating effective data visualization and will introduce tools and techniques for visualizing large, high-dimensional data using R. We will review fundamental concepts for visually displaying quantitative information, such as using series of small multiples, avoiding "chart-junk," and maximizing the data-ink ratio. After briefly covering data visualization using base R graphics, we will introduce the _ggplot2_ package for advanced high-dimensional visualization. We will cover the grammar of graphics (geoms, aesthetics, stats, and faceting), and using ggplot2 to create plots layer-by-layer. Upon completing this lesson, students will be able to use R to explore a high-dimensional dataset by faceting and scaling arbitrarily complex plots in small multiples.

### Week 4: Reproducible Research & Dynamic Documents

Contemporary life sciences research is plagued by reproducibility issues. This session covers some of the barriers to reproducible research and how to start to address some of those problems during the data management and analysis phases of the research life cycle. In this session we will cover using R and dynamic document generation with RMarkdown and RStudio to weave together reporting text with executable R code to automatically generate reports in the form of PDF, Word, or HTML documents.

### Week 5: Essential Statistics

This session will provide hands-on instruction and exercises covering basic statistical analysis in R. This will cover descriptive statistics, t-tests, linear models, chi-square, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and resampling strategies. We will also cover methods for "tidying" model results for downstream visualization and summarization.

### Week 6-7a: Survival Analysis

This session will provide hands-on instruction and exercises covering survival analysis using R. The data for parts of this session will come from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), where we will also cover programmatic access to TCGA through Bioconductor.

### Week 6-7b: Predictive Modeling & Forecasting

This session will provide hands-on instruction for using machine learning algorithms to predict a disease outcome. We will cover data cleaning, feature extraction, imputation, and using a variety of models to try to predict disease outcome. We will use resampling strategies to assess the performance of predictive modeling procedures such as Random Forest, stochastic gradient boosting, elastic net regularized regression (LASSO), and k-nearest neighbors. We will also demonstrate demonstrate how to _forecast_ future trends given historical infectious disease surveillance data using methodology that accounts for seasonality and nonlinearity. 

### Week 6-7c: Introduction to RNA-seq Data Analysis

This session focuses on analyzing real data from a biological application - analyzing RNA-seq data for differentially expressed genes. This session provides an introduction to RNA-seq data analysis, involving reading in count data from an RNA-seq experiment, exploring the data using base R functions and then analysis with the DESeq2 Bioconductor package. The session will conclude with downstream pathway analysis and exploring the biological and functional context of the results.

### Week 6-7d: Visualizing and Annotating Phylogenetic Trees

This lesson demonstrates how to use R and ggtree, an extension of the ggplot2 package, to visualize and annotate phylogenetic trees. This lesson does _not_ cover methods and software for _generating_ phylogenetic trees, nor does it it cover _interpreting_ phylogenies. Genome-wide sequencing allows for examination of the entire genome, and from this, many methods and software tools exist for comparative genomics using SNP- and gene-based phylogenetic analysis, either from unassembled sequencing reads, draft assemblies/contigs, or complete genome sequences. These methods are beyond the scope of this lesson.

### Week 6-7e: Text mining

Under development.
